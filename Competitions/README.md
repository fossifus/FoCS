## Here be all of the frameworks and submissions from all of the coding competitions.


#Running the code:
This is working code for a battleship match between two AI players. Two very simple default AI's have been provided. 
After downloading you can ensure the code works by running either one of two classes. 

*BattleshipMatch
	This code will pit playerOne agains playerTwo in up two 1000 matches. This is the code that will be used in the tournament.
	This file will print the results of the match
	
*BattleshipSingleMatchAnimation
	This code will show an animation of a single match. 
	This can be really useful for seeing how your algorithm operates in real match.
	This is what will be shown to reveal the winner
	This code may require you to install ffmpeg.... something or other, need to look into it. @Jake We may have to figure something else out here


#Adding AI logic
Modify only the two classes PlayerOne and PlayerTwo
Both of these classes inherit from the AItemplate class. Make sure you correctly inherit from this class.
Both PlayerOne and PlayerTwo receive all the information that a real player would receive playing battleship. This information is provided
